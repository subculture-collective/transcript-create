# Docker Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the Docker image optimization work completed as part of issue #XX.

## Overview

The Docker images for transcript-create have been optimized using multi-stage builds, BuildKit features, and best practices for container image creation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Stage Builds

All Docker variants now use a 3-stage build process:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Base - System dependencies
FROM base-image AS base
RUN apt-get install system-dependencies

# Stage 2: Python Dependencies
FROM base AS python-deps
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Stage 3: Application
FROM base AS app
COPY --from=python-deps /usr/local/lib/python3.X/site-packages
COPY . /app
```

**Benefits:**
- Better layer caching - only rebuild changed stages
- Faster rebuild times (2-5 min with cache vs 15-20 min from scratch)
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 2. BuildKit Optimizations

#### Cache Mounts
```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

This persists pip's download cache across builds, significantly speeding up dependency installation.

#### GitHub Actions Cache Integration
```yaml
cache-from: type=gha
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

Shares cache across workflow runs and branches for faster CI builds.

### 3. Layer Optimization

Layers are ordered by change frequency:
1. System packages (rarely change) - bottom layer
2. Python dependencies (change occasionally) - middle layer
3. Application code (change frequently) - top layer

This maximizes cache hits during development.

### 4. Image Variants

Three optimized variants are available:

| Variant | Base Image | Size | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|
| **ROCm** | rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:6.0.2 | ~2.3GB | AMD GPU production |
| **CPU** | python:3.11-slim | ~8GB | Development/testing |
| **CUDA** | nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-runtime | ~2.4GB | NVIDIA GPU production |

### 5. Health Checks

All images include health checks:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
```

Enables:
- Automatic container restart on failure
- Better orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Compose)
- Load balancer health monitoring

### 6. Security Enhancements

#### Trivy Scanning
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Scans for CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues

#### Minimal Attack Surface
- Cleaned apt cache: `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`
- Use `--no-install-recommends` for apt packages
- Only install required system dependencies

### 7. Runtime Optimizations

#### Pre-compiled Python
```dockerfile
RUN python3 -m compileall -q /app
```
Reduces startup time by pre-compiling .py to .pyc files.

#### Optimal Environment Variables
```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1
```

### 8. Enhanced .dockerignore

Excludes unnecessary files:
- Tests (tests/, e2e/)
- CI/CD (.github/)
- Documentation (docs/, *.md except DEPENDENCIES.md)
- Development tools (.vscode, .idea)
- Kubernetes configs (k8s/, charts/)
- Backups and data
- Build artifacts

Result: Smaller context, faster builds.

## Build Scripts

Convenient scripts for each variant:

```bash
# ROCm variant
./scripts/build-rocm.sh [version] [--no-cache] [--push]

# CPU variant
./scripts/build-cpu.sh [--no-cache] [--push]

# CUDA variant
./scripts/build-cuda.sh [version] [--no-cache] [--push]

# Compare sizes
./scripts/compare-image-sizes.sh
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Main Workflow (docker-build.yml)
- Builds ROCm variant on push to main
- Uses GitHub Actions cache
- Runs Trivy security scan
- Pushes to GHCR with tags

### All Variants Workflow (docker-build-variants.yml)
- Manual trigger to build all variants
- Parallel builds for faster completion
- Security scans for each variant
- Summary report with sizes

## Performance Metrics

### Build Times
- **No cache**: 15-20 minutes
- **With cache**: 2-5 minutes (70-80% faster)
- **CPU variant**: 8-12 min / 1-3 min (lighter dependencies)

### Image Sizes
- **ROCm**: ~2.3GB (target: <2.5GB) ✅
- **CUDA**: ~2.4GB (target: <2.5GB) ✅
- **CPU**: ~8GB (Note: Larger due to comprehensive dependencies)

## Known Limitations

### CPU Variant Size
The CPU variant is ~8GB instead of the target <1GB due to comprehensive dependencies in requirements.txt:

- pyannote.audio requires torch>=2.8.0
- Many ML/AI packages pull in CUDA dependencies
- Full feature set requires significant libraries

**Solutions for smaller CPU images:**
1. Create requirements-minimal.txt excluding:
   - pyannote.audio (diarization)
   - Optional ML features
   - Heavy dependencies
2. Use this for development/testing scenarios
3. Accept larger size for full-featured CPU deployment

### Non-root User
The images currently run as root to avoid permission issues with Docker Compose volume mounts. For production with non-root:
- Use Kubernetes security contexts
- Use volume ownership management
- Use user namespace remapping

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation available:
- **[docs/DOCKER_VARIANTS.md](../docs/DOCKER_VARIANTS.md)** - Detailed variant guide
  - Build instructions
  - Run commands
  - Troubleshooting
  - Security best practices

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Build variant
./scripts/build-cpu.sh

# Test imports
docker run --rm transcript-create:cpu python3 -c "import torch; import fastapi; print('✓ Success')"

# Test health check
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 transcript-create:cpu
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Compare sizes
./scripts/compare-image-sizes.sh
```

### Automated Testing
- GitHub Actions builds all variants
- Trivy security scans
- Size verification

## Future Improvements

1. **Smaller CPU Image**: Create requirements-minimal.txt
2. **Non-root User**: Add user configuration for production
3. **Image Signing**: Implement cosign for image signing
4. **ARM Support**: Add linux/arm64 platform builds
5. **Distroless**: Experiment with distroless base images
