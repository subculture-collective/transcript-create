# Alembic Migration System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Alembic-based database migration system for the transcript-create project, replacing direct SQL schema application with a version-controlled, repeatable migration workflow.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Infrastructure

**Alembic Configuration:**

- Added `alembic==1.14.0` to requirements.txt
- Initialized Alembic in the repository with `alembic init alembic`
- Configured `alembic.ini` with:
  - Timestamped migration file names: `YYYYMMDD_HHMM_<revision>_<slug>.py`
  - Black code formatting hook enabled
  - Database URL sourced from app settings
- Updated `alembic/env.py` to:
  - Import and use app settings for DATABASE_URL
  - Support PostgreSQL with psycopg3 driver
  - Use target_metadata=None (manual migrations, not auto-generate)

**Baseline Migration:**

- Created initial migration `5cd038a8f131_initial_schema_baseline.py`
- Captures complete schema from `sql/schema.sql` including:
  - pgcrypto extension
  - job_state enum type
  - All tables: jobs, videos, transcripts, segments, youtube_transcripts, youtube_segments, users, sessions, favorites, events
  - All indexes and full-text search support
  - Triggers and functions for tsvector updates
- Implements both upgrade() and downgrade() functions for rollback support

**Sample Migration:**

- Created example migration `b7c3b2171954_add_videos_thumbnail_url_example.py`
- Demonstrates adding a column with index
- Shows proper idempotent SQL with IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS
- Includes downgrade logic for rollback

### 2. Helper Tools

**Migration Script (`scripts/run_migrations.py`):**

- Wrapper around Alembic commands for ease of use
- Supports common operations:
  - `upgrade` - Apply pending migrations
  - `downgrade` - Rollback migrations
  - `current` - Show current revision
  - `history` - View migration history
  - `stamp` - Mark database at specific revision (for existing databases)
- Automatically finds alembic.ini in project root
- Returns proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 3. Docker Integration

**Updated docker-compose.yml:**

- Added `migrations` service that runs before API/worker
- Added health check to postgres service
- Updated service dependencies:
  - `db` → `migrations` → `api`/`worker`
  - Uses `condition: service_healthy` for db
  - Uses `condition: service_completed_successfully` for migrations
- Migrations run automatically on `docker compose up`
- Note: Removed automatic schema.sql application from db service

### 4. CI/CD Validation

**New Workflow (`.github/workflows/migrations-ci.yml`):**

Three comprehensive test jobs:

1. **validate-migrations-fresh**
   - Tests migrations on empty database
   - Applies all migrations from scratch
   - Verifies all expected tables exist
   - Checks migration history

2. **validate-migrations-from-existing**
   - Simulates existing production database
   - Applies original schema.sql
   - Stamps database at baseline
   - Verifies no pending migrations after stamping
   - Tests migration from existing schema workflow

3. **validate-migration-downgrade**
   - Tests full upgrade → downgrade → upgrade cycle
   - Verifies migrations are reversible
   - Ensures schema cleanup on downgrade
   - Confirms re-upgrade works correctly

All jobs:

- Use PostgreSQL 16 service container
- Run on Python 3.11
- Include explicit permissions (contents: read) for security
- Provide clear success/failure indicators

### 5. Testing

**Test Suite (`tests/test_migrations.py`):**

- Comprehensive pytest suite covering:
  - Fresh migration application
  - Complete downgrade to base
  - Up/down/up cycle testing
  - Migration history retrieval
  - Current revision checking
  - Stamp and upgrade workflow
- Uses context manager for proper engine cleanup
- Includes `clean_db` fixture that drops all objects before each test
- Tests use consistent database URL from environment
- All tests properly dispose of database connections

### 6. Documentation

## Migration Workflow

### For New Installations

```bash
python scripts/run_migrations.py upgrade
```

### For Existing Databases

```bash
# Stamp at baseline to indicate schema already exists
python scripts/run_migrations.py stamp head
```

### Creating New Migrations

```bash
# 1. Create migration file
alembic revision -m "descriptive_name"

# 2. Edit upgrade() and downgrade() functions
# 3. Test locally
python scripts/run_migrations.py upgrade
python scripts/run_migrations.py downgrade
python scripts/run_migrations.py upgrade

# 4. Commit and push (CI validates automatically)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Version Control**: Every schema change tracked in version control
2. **Repeatability**: Same migrations = same schema across all environments
3. **Rollback**: All migrations include downgrade for safe rollback
4. **Automation**: Migrations run automatically in Docker/CI
5. **Documentation**: Each migration documents what changed and why
6. **Testing**: All migrations validated in CI before merge
7. **Safety**: Prevents schema drift between environments
8. **Auditability**: Complete history of schema evolution

## Security

- No vulnerabilities in Alembic 1.14.0 (verified via gh-advisory-database)
- No security issues in migration code (verified via codeql_checker)
- Workflow permissions properly scoped (contents: read)
- All database operations use parameterized queries

## Testing Coverage

- Unit tests: 7 test cases covering all migration operations
- Integration tests: 3 CI jobs covering fresh, existing, and up/down scenarios
- All tests pass with proper cleanup and isolation

## Breaking Changes

**Note for existing deployments:**

- `docker-compose.yml` no longer auto-applies `sql/schema.sql`
- Existing databases must be stamped: `python scripts/run_migrations.py stamp head`
- New deployments automatically run migrations via the `migrations` service

## Maintenance

### Adding New Migrations

1. Create migration: `alembic revision -m "description"`
2. Implement upgrade() and downgrade()
3. Test both directions locally
4. Commit (CI validates automatically)

### Reviewing Migrations

- Review as you would any code change
- Check upgrade() for correctness
- Verify downgrade() properly reverts changes
- Ensure idempotency where possible
- Check for data safety
